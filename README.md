# Final assignment: Introduction to Robotics

> Mobile Manipulation Project
>> The final project consists of a simulation in Gazebo of a TIAGo robot in an apartment. The robot is equipped with several onboard sensors and a manipulator arm which enable it to autonomously navigate and interact with the environment through simple manipulation tasks. The goal of this project is to implement a mission planner for TIAGo to execute three different missions.
